AWS Infra Logs to GCP BigQuery
------------------------------

1. VPC Flow Log -> Cloud Watch -> Kinesis -> Lambda -> WIF -> GCP -> BigQuery
2. VPC Flow Log -> Cloud Watch -> Kinesis -> Consumer -> WIF -> GCP -> BigQuery - this would need Dynamo DB to store check point/offset
3. VPC Flow Log -> S3 -> Lambda -> WIF -> GCP -> BigQuery - This would need a SQS Dead Letter Queue
4. SQL Queue -> Lambda -> WIF -> GCP -> BigQuery
