UI has big buttons and always goes to message directly..accessibility options if needed for audio or biggest font.



If device battery is low then reminder to plug in device some before appointment. Keep following up after X minutes if not plugged in.

--check MDM web service ot get battery level of users device, if <30% send the above message
